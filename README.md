# ViaTesting
Simple tool to create minecraft servers with Via* preinstalled.

For the custom java version you need a folder in the same directory as the jar named java-xx e.g. java-18

This tool was made for easier debugging & support and is not meant to create production servers.

**Please note that is tool is still in early progress, see [*Projects*](https://github.com/Jo0001/ViaTesting/projects/1) for more information**
