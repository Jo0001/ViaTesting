# ViaTesting
Simple tool to create minecraft servers (Paper, Waterfall, ...) with Via* preinstalled.

For the custom java version you need a folder in the same directory as the jar named java-xx (8, 11, 17, 21) e.g. java-17

This tool was made for easier debugging & support and is not meant to create production servers.
